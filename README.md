##Employee Data Analysis - ABC Company
üìå Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the employee dataset of ABC Company, containing 458 rows and 9 columns. The objective is to preprocess the data, extract meaningful insights, and visualize trends related to employee distribution, salaries, and correlations.

üîç Key Tasks & Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing
The "height" column contained inconsistent or missing data. It was replaced with random values between 150 and 180 cm to maintain consistency.
Missing values in the "Salary" column were imputed with the median salary to ensure accurate analysis.
Data types were checked and converted where necessary for consistency.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Analysis Tasks
Employee Distribution Across Teams
The number of employees per team was calculated.
The percentage of employees per team was determined.
Position-Based Segregation
Employees were grouped based on their roles (e.g., Manager, Engineer, Analyst).
Predominant Age Group
Employees were categorized into age groups (e.g., 20-30, 30-40, etc.).
The most common age group was identified.
Salary Expenditure by Team & Position
The total salary expenditure was calculated for each team.
The position with the highest salary was determined.
Correlation Between Age and Salary
The relationship between age and salary was explored.
A scatter plot was used to visualize any correlation.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Graphical Representations
To make the insights clearer, we used the following visualizations:
‚úÖ Bar Charts for team distribution and salary expenditure.
‚úÖ Pie Charts to display the percentage of employees in different teams.
‚úÖ Histograms for analyzing the age distribution.
‚úÖ Box Plots to detect salary outliers.
‚úÖ Scatter Plots to examine correlations between salary and age.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Insights Gained
The majority of employees were concentrated in a few specific teams.
The Engineering and Management teams had the highest salary expenses.
There was a moderate correlation between age and salary, indicating that experience plays a role in salary growth.
The age group 30-40 had the highest number of employees.
Certain positions had extreme salary values, requiring further investigation.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Information
The dataset was cleaned and saved as cleaned_dataset.csv after preprocessing.
Future improvements could include predictive analytics to forecast salary trends.
üí° Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into ABC Company's workforce, highlighting trends in salary distribution, team structures, and age demographics. By combining data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualizations, we transformed raw employee data into actionable intelligence. üöÄ
